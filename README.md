# Business-Performance-Analytics-Kimia-Farma

## Introduction
This project is part of the Virtual Project-Based Internship program organized by Rakamin Academy in collaboration with Kimia Farma. In this program, I took on the role of a Big Data Analyst, responsible for performing data analysis and creating visualizations to support data driven decision making.


## Objective
- Building analysis tables (data marts) to support dashboard visualization.
- Designing and delivering an interactive dashboard to analyze and monitor business performance.


## Tools
- Google BigQuery
- Google Looker Studio

## Business Question
- What is the trend in Kimia Farma's revenue growth from year to year, and are there any significant patterns of increase or decrease?
- How is Kimia Farma's total profit distributed across each province in Indonesia, and which regions are the largest and smallest profit centers?
- Which product has the highest number of purchases?
- Which provinces are in the top 5 based on total transactions and net sales?
- Which branch has the highest rating, but low transaction rating?


## Process
- Process raw data using SQL in BigQuery to clean the data and ensure it is ready for analysis.
- Integrate processed data from Google BigQuery into Google Looker Studio.
- Developing an interactive dashboard to analyze business performance
